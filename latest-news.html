<h2>Coronavirus: EU plan for tougher controls on vaccine exports</h2>

</div>

<p>The European Commission has proposed tougher controls on Covid vaccine exports after it accused UK-Swedish firm AstraZeneca of failing to honour its contract to supply EU countries. </p>

<p>The plans, to go before EU leaders on Thursday, stop short of a ban but could inflame tensions with the UK.</p>

<p>Any shipment would be assessed on the destination country's rate of vaccinations and vaccine exports.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that "blockades" were not "sensible".</p>

<p>
EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides rejected a suggestion that the European Commission's aim was to punish the UK in particular: "We're dealing with a pandemic and this is not seeking to punish any countries."
</p>
<p>Asked in the House of Commons whether the UK might retaliate, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he did not believe "that blockades of either vaccines or of medicines, of ingredients for vaccines" would be "sensible". Companies might draw conclusions about future investments "in countries where arbitrary blockades are imposed," he added.

<h2>Coronavirus: Germany's Merkel reverses plans for Easter lockdown</h2>
<div id="hero">

</div>
<p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel has cancelled plans for a strict lockdown over Easter, just a day after the measures were announced.</p>

<p>Calling the plan a "mistake", Mrs Merkel said she took "ultimate responsibility" for the U-turn.</p>

<p>The proposed lockdown was agreed with regional leaders in talks overnight on Monday, with restrictions set to be tightened between 1-5 April.</p>

<p>But the plan was reversed following a crisis meeting on Wednesday.</p>

<p>It had been widely criticised by business leaders and scientists.</p>

<p>The lockdown would have been Germany's strictest yet, with most shops closed and gatherings limited.</p>

<p>For five days over Easter from 1 April, Germans would have been asked to stay at home and reduce social contact.</p>

<p>In-person religious services would have been cancelled, large family gatherings banned and almost all shops would have been closed.</p>

<p>The head of Mrs Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, Armin Laschet, told a regional parliament meeting on Wednesday that the lockdown was "not enforceable in this form".</p>

<p>"This mistake is mine alone," Mrs Merkel told reporters in Berlin. "The whole process has caused additional uncertainty, for which I ask all citizens to forgive me."</p>

<p>"There were good reasons for it but it could not be implemented well enough in this short time," she added.

<h2>Egypt's Suez Canal blocked by huge container ship</h2>
<div id="hero">

</div>
<p>
  <p>A giant container ship the length of four football pitches has become wedged across Egypt's Suez Canal, blocking one of the world's busiest trade routes.</p>

<p>  Dozens of vessels are stuck, waiting for rescue boats to free the 400m-long (1,312ft) ship, which was knocked off course by strong winds.</p>

<p>  Egypt has reopened the canal's older channel to divert some traffic until the grounded ship can move again.</p>

<p>  The blockage sent oil prices climbing on international markets.</p>

<p>  About 12% of global trade passes through the Suez Canal, which connects the Mediterranean to the Red Sea and provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>  The Ever Given, registered in Panama, was bound for the port city of Rotterdam in the Netherlands from China and was passing northwards through the canal on its way to the Mediterranean.</p>
  <p> The 200,000 tonne ship, built in 2018 and operated by Taiwanese transport company Evergreen Marine, ran aground and became lodged sideways across the waterway at about 07:40 local time (05:40 GMT) on Tuesday.</p>


  <p>  At 400m long and 59m wide, the ship has blocked the path of other vessels which are now trapped in lines in both directions.</p>

    <p>The company that manages the container ship, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM), has denied earlier reports that the ship had already been partially refloated.
